        <p>
            I have been in Emergency Medical Services since 2005 when I joined my local rural rescue squad as a JR Member because my friend was doing it. The moment I ran my first call I knew this was it for me. In 2006, I took my Emergency Medical Technician Basic course and in 2007 I was cleared as an Attendant in Charge on an ambulance and was running my first calls. Soon I had become a Nationally Registered Paramedic and was hired at a fire department as a Firefighter/Medic. Eventually I moved onto disaster management and then became an instructor in a multitude of EMS courses. This is where my story could have ended but I found myself becoming burned out and got scared. I didn't want to lose my passion for EMS and I know the statistics. While at heart I am, and will always be, a firefighter/EMT, I knew I needed to branch out and so started my second career of computer coding.
